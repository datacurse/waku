We‚Äôre happy to announce Waku v0.25 with a brand new API: the Slice Components!

We heard the feedback around the Page Part components and feel like the Slices API will both solve a lot of the issues, while also unlocking brand new flexibility with render patterns!

## Components are re-useable across pages

Slices are components that are defined anywhere in the `src/pages` with `_slice-` as the start of their filename. This allows us to re-use slices across pages as any other component would be used.

```
 src/pages
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _components
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _slice-one.tsx
 ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _slice-two.tsx
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ some-page.tsx
```

And some-page.tsx will be written something like this:

```tsx
import { Slice } from 'waku';

export default function SomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Slice id="one" />
      <Slice id="two" />
    </div>
  );
}

export const getConfig = () => {
  return {
    render: 'static',
    slices: ['one', 'two'],
  };
};
```

Please notice: `slices` must be specified with each of the slice ids in order for waku to know how to bundle your page without any compiler magic.

The file convention for Slice components is `_slice-${string}.tsx` (TypeScript string literal syntax). We will look for these anywhere in the `src/pages` directory. And by default, the slice id will be the filename without the `_slice-` prefix.

An example for `_slice-one.tsx`:

```tsx
export default function SliceOne() {
  return <p>üçï</p>;
}

export const getConfig = () => {
  return {
    id: 'one', // can be omitted if it can be taken from the file name
    render: 'static', // default is 'dynamic'
  };
};
```

We're really happy with the new approach and how it will allow simply importing and assembling your components like normal components.

## Lazy Slice Components

`lazy` Slice Components are a new addition with the Slices API. They allow components to be requested separately from the page they are used on. This is useful for components that are expensive to render, or components that could be hosted separately (e.g. on a CDN).

If we re-use the example above, it could be written like this:

```tsx
import { Slice } from 'waku';

export default function SomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Slice id="one" />
      <Slice id="two" lazy fallback={<p>Two is loading...</p>} />
    </div>
  );
}

export const getConfig = () => {
  return {
    render: 'static',
    slices: ['one'], // Note: `two` is lazy so it is not included with the page config
  };
};
```

This makes it so that now you can have a `dynamic` Slice component for slice `two` here, while the rest of the page is static.

## There‚Äôs more to come

We're keeping Waku Router minimal and making it even more powerful with this release. We‚Äôre really excited to see what you can build with Slices and would love to hear from you on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/MrQdmzd), [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/wakujs/waku/discussions), or [around](https://x.com/wakujs) [the](https://bsky.app/profile/daishikato.com) [web](https://fosstodon.org/@daishi).

P.S., We have a [few more things](https://github.com/wakujs/waku/issues/24) coming soon!
